            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p> 
                I am seeking the opportunity to utilise my coding and software development skills after recently completing my Bachelor of Computer Science, 
                majoring in Software Engineering where I achieved a High Distinction average. I have relied on my time management, attention to detail, 
                efficiency, and communication skills to be successful throughout my time at university across two bachelor’s degrees and working life. I 
                have also taken on many projects outside of university, which can be found at my GitHub link above; and I am constantly working to improve 
                my Python problem solving capabilities via Hackerrank. Although I have focused on back-end development and Python as my preferred language I 
                am open to all opportunities as my degree has provided me with surface level knowledge of many areas/languages including C++, C#, Java, LUA, 
                QL, PHP and Matlab. 
            </p>

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            <h4>Projects</h4>
            <p>
                My GitHub contains many of my projects, I would recommend checking out the Wordle Solver if you have the game already or the Snake Game as some 
                easy to use programs I have written. There is also a video located in the Trophy and Engraving Business Program repository that details a 
                program I have written for a business that is currently in use. The code can be provided on request.
            </p>

                Owned and ran a small business out of a warehouse selling furniture, mostly barstools, for a little over a year. I managed everything from importing 
                containers to negotiating warehouse leases and building a website. Running this business encompassed a huge array of areas and allowed me to learn many 
                new skills. It also allowed me to see just how hard it can be to run a business and contributed to me becoming a better worker.<br>

                stock management, delivery driving (truck), packing, furniture repairs and other odd jobs. I was required to plan the daily deliveries and give approximate 
                arrival times to customers, complete stock transfers and manage my offsider on a regular day. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Coles</b><br>
                Shop Assistant<br>

                This casual position covered a whole range of jobs in the store including stocking shelves, working checkouts and customer service. Throughout my time I 
                experienced a lot of different team dynamics and positions within those teams, being both the junior and most senior member at different stages. <br>
